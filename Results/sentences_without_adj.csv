was
in
swing

steadily

with
the

"
"
beside

sat
only
one

","
who
with
her
face
"
"
was
rather
out
of
place
in
this
society
","
the
company
had
"
"
settled
into
three
groups
.
one
","
chiefly
masculine
","
had
formed
"
"
the
abbÃ©
.
another
","
of

was
grouped
round
the
beautiful
"
"
princess
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
","
prince

the

"
bolkÃ³nskaya
","
very
and
","
though
rather
too
for
her
age
.
"
"
the
group
was
gathered
round
mortemart
and
anna
pÃ¡vlovna
.
"

"
the
vicomte
was
a
nice
-
looking
man
with
features
and
polished
"
"
manners
","
who
evidently
considered
himself
a
celebrity
but
out
of
"
"
politeness
modestly
placed
himself
at
the
disposal
of
the
circle
in
"
"
which
he
found
himself
.
anna
pÃ¡vlovna

a

it

"
the
kitchen

anna

served
up

first
the
vicomte

then
the
abbÃ©
","
as

"
"
morsels

the
group
about

immediately
began
discussing
the
"
"
murder
of
the
duc
dâenghien
.
the
vicomte
said
that
the
duc
dâenghien
"
"
had
perished
by
his
magnanimity
","
and
that
there
were
"

reasons

hatred

â
ah

"
"
with
a
feeling
that
there
was
something
Ã

in

"
"
sound
of

sentence
:

"

"
the
vicomte
bowed

smiled
courteously
in
token
of
his
willingness

"
"
comply

anna

arranged

"
â

one
of

"
"
to

the

served
up
to

style

.
"

"
the
vicomte
wished

smile

sitting
some
way
off

the
center
of

"
another

.
"

"
the

smiled

she
rose
with
the
smile
with
which
"
"
she
had
first
entered
the
room
â
the
smile

"

woman

with

trimmed
with

she
passed
between

made
way
for
her
","
not
looking
"
"
at
any
of
them

smiling
on
all
","
as
if
graciously
allowing
each
the
"
"
privilege

admiring
her
figure

shapely
shoulders
","
"
"
back
","

â
which
in
the
fashion
of
those
days
were
very
much
"
"
exposed
â
and
she
seemed
to
bring
the
glamour
of
a
ballroom
with
her
as
"
"
she
moved
toward
anna
pÃ¡vlovna
.
hÃ©lÃ¨ne
was
so
that
not
only
"
"
did
she
not
show
any
trace
of
coquetry
","
but
on
the
contrary
she
even
"
"
appeared
of
her

all
too
beauty
.
she
"
"
seemed
to
wish

but
to
be
","
to
diminish
its
effect
.
"

"
â
how
!
â
said
everyone
who
saw
her
;
and
the
vicomte
lifted
his
"
"
shoulders
and
dropped
his
eyes
as
if
startled
by
something
"
"
when
she
took
her
seat
opposite

beamed
upon
him
also
with
her
"
"
smile

"
â

his

"
the
princess
rested
her
arm
on
a
table
and
considered
"
"
a
reply

she
smilingly
waited
.
all

sat
","
glancing

at

"
"
altered

by
its
pressure
on
the
table
","
now
at
her
still
"
"
bosom

readjusted

smoothed
the

produced
an

the

into
her
smile

"
the

there

movement

smiling

talking

"
merrily
to

asking

she

"
took
up
her
work

"
prince
hippolyte
","
having
brought

joined

"
moving
a
chair
to
hers
seated
himself
beside

.
"

"
le
charmant
hippolyte
was
by
his
resemblance
"
"
to
his
sister
","
but
yet
by
the
fact
that
in

of
"
"
this
resemblance
he
was
exceedingly
.
his
features
were
like
his
"
"
sister
âs
","
but
while
in
her
case
everything
was
lit
up
by

"
"
self

","
","

smile

animation

and
by
the

"
beauty

his

"
was
dulled
by
imbecility

the

â

in
a
tone

"
which
showed
that
he
only
understood
the
meaning
of
his
words
after
he
"
"
had
uttered
them
.
"

"
he
spoke
with
self

confidence
that
his
hearers
could
not

"
whether
what
he
said

"
the
vicomte
told
his
tale
very
neatly
.
it
was
an
anecdote
","
then
","
"
"
to
the
effect
that
the
duc
dâenghien
had
gone
secretly
to
paris
to
"
"
visit
mademoiselle
george

came
upon

enjoyed

that

"
"
this
magnanimity
bonaparte

repaid

death

"
the

was
very
and
","

at
the
point
"
"
where
the
rivals
suddenly
recognized
one
another
;

the

looked
"
"
agitated

"
â

an
inquiring

â

whispered
the

sticking

her
work

"
it
was
past
one

left

it
was
a
"
"
cloudless
","
","
summer
night
.
pierre
took
an
cab
intending
"
"
to
drive
home
.
but
the
nearer
he
drew
to

the
more
he
"
"
felt
the
impossibility
of
going
to
sleep
on
such
a
night
.
it
was
"
"
to
see
a
way
in

it
seemed
like
"
"
morning
or
evening
than
night
.
on
the
way
pierre
remembered
that

was
expecting

to

he

occurred
to
him
