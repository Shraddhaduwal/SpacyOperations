"
anna
pávlovna
’s
reception
was
in
swing
.
the
spindles
hummed
"
"
steadily
and
ceaselessly
on
all
sides
.
with
the
exception
of
the
aunt
","
"
"
beside
whom
sat
only
one
lady
","
who
with
her
face
"
"
was
rather
out
of
place
in
this
society
","
the
company
had
"
"
settled
into
three
groups
.
one
","
chiefly
masculine
","
had
formed
"
"
the
abbé
.
another
","
of
people
","
was
grouped
round
the
beautiful
"
"
princess
hélène
","
prince
vasíli
’s
daughter
","
and
the
princess
"
"
bolkónskaya
","
very
and
","
though
rather
too
for
her
age
.
"
"
the
group
was
gathered
round
mortemart
and
anna
pávlovna
.
"

"
the
vicomte
was
a
nice
-
looking
man
with
features
and
polished
"
"
manners
","
who
evidently
considered
himself
a
celebrity
but
out
of
"
"
politeness
modestly
placed
himself
at
the
disposal
of
the
circle
in
"
"
which
he
found
himself
.
anna
pávlovna
was
obviously
serving
him
up
as
"
"
a
treat
to
her
guests
.
as
a
maître
d’hôtel
serves
up
as
a
"
"
specially
choice
delicacy
a
piece
of
meat
that
no
one
who
had
seen
it
in
"
"
the
kitchen
would
have
cared
to
eat
","
so
anna
pávlovna
served
up
to
"
"
her
guests
","
first
the
vicomte
and
then
the
abbé
","
as
choice
"
"
morsels
.
the
group
about
mortemart
immediately
began
discussing
the
"
"
murder
of
the
duc
d’enghien
.
the
vicomte
said
that
the
duc
d’enghien
"
"
had
perished
by
his
magnanimity
","
and
that
there
were
"
"
reasons
for
buonaparte
’s
hatred
of
him
.
"

"
“
ah
","
yes
!
do
tell
us
all
about
it
","
vicomte
","
”
said
anna
pávlovna
","
"
"
with
a
feeling
that
there
was
something
à
la
louis
xv
in
the
"
"
sound
of
that
sentence
:
“
contez
nous
çela
","
vicomte
.
”
"

"
the
vicomte
bowed
and
smiled
courteously
in
token
of
his
willingness
to
"
"
comply
.
anna
pávlovna
arranged
a
group
round
him
","
inviting
everyone
to
"
"
listen
to
his
tale
.
"

"
“
the
vicomte
knew
the
duc
personally
","
”
whispered
anna
pávlovna
to
"
"
one
of
the
guests
.
“
the
vicomte
is
a
raconteur
","
”
said
she
"
"
to
another
.
“
how
evidently
he
belongs
to
the
society
","
”
said
she
"
"
to
a
;
and
the
vicomte
was
served
up
to
the
company
in
the
choicest
"
"
and
most
style
","
like
a
well
-
joint
of
roast
beef
"
"
on
a
dish
.
"

"
the
vicomte
wished
to
begin
his
story
and
gave
a
smile
.
"

"
“
come
over
here
","
hélène
","
dear
","
”
said
anna
pávlovna
to
the
"
"
princess
who
was
sitting
some
way
off
","
the
center
of
"
"
another
group
.
"

"
the
princess
smiled
.
she
rose
with
the
smile
with
which
"
"
she
had
first
entered
the
room
—
the
smile
of
a
perfectly
"
"
woman
.
with
a
rustle
of
her
dress
trimmed
with
moss
"
"
and
ivy
","
with
a
gleam
of
shoulders

hair
","
and
sparkling
"
"
diamonds
","
she
passed
between
the
men
who
made
way
for
her
","
not
looking
"
"
at
any
of
them
but
smiling
on
all
","
as
if
graciously
allowing
each
the
"
"
privilege
of
admiring
her
figure
and
shapely
shoulders
","
"
"
back
","
and
bosom
—
which
in
the
fashion
of
those
days
were
very
much
"
"
exposed
—
and
she
seemed
to
bring
the
glamour
of
a
ballroom
with
her
as
"
"
she
moved
toward
anna
pávlovna
.
hélène
was
so
that
not
only
"
"
did
she
not
show
any
trace
of
coquetry
","
but
on
the
contrary
she
even
"
"
appeared
of
her
and
all
too
beauty
.
she
"
"
seemed
to
wish
","
but
to
be
","
to
diminish
its
effect
.
"

"
“
how
!
”
said
everyone
who
saw
her
;
and
the
vicomte
lifted
his
"
"
shoulders
and
dropped
his
eyes
as
if
startled
by
something
"
"
when
she
took
her
seat
opposite
and
beamed
upon
him
also
with
her
"
"
smile
.
"

"
“
madame
","
i
doubt
my
ability

an
audience

”
said
he
","
"
"
smilingly
inclining
his
head
.
"

"
the
princess
rested
her
arm
on
a
table
and
considered
"
"
a
reply
.
she
smilingly
waited
.
all
the
time
the
story
was
"
"
being
told
she
sat
","
glancing
now
at
her
arm
","
"
"
altered
in
shape
by
its
pressure
on
the
table
","
now
at
her
still
"
"
bosom
","
on
which
she
readjusted
a
diamond
necklace
.
from
time
"
"
to

she
smoothed
the
folds

the

produced
an
effect
she

the

into
her
smile

"
the

left

"
there
was
a
movement

smiling

talking

"
merrily
to
everyone

sat
down

"
“

she

","

asking

she
"
"
took
up
her
work

"

"
prince
hippolyte
","
having
brought
the

","
joined
the
circle

"
"
moving
a
chair
to
hers
seated
himself
beside
her
.
"

"
le
charmant
hippolyte
was
by
his
resemblance
"
"
to
his
sister
","
but
yet
by
the
fact
that
in

of
"
"
this
resemblance
he
was
exceedingly
.
his
features
were
like
his
"
"
sister
’s
","
but
while
in
her
case
everything
was
lit
up
by
a
","
"
"
self
-
","
","
and
smile
of
animation
","
and
by
the
"
"
beauty
of
her
figure
","
his
face
on
the
"
"
was
dulled
by
imbecility
and
a
expression
of
"
"
self
-
confidence
","
while
his
body
was

his

puckered
into

his

fell
into

"
“

he
","

down

"
the
princess

","
as

"

"
“

shrugging
"
"
his

.
"

"
“

hate

”
said
prince
hippolyte
in
a
tone
"
"
which
showed
that
he
only
understood
the
meaning
of
his
words
after
he
"
"
had
uttered
them
.
"

"
he
spoke
with
self
-
confidence
that
his
hearers
could
not
be
"
"
whether
what
he
said

he
called
it
","

and
silk
stockings
.
"

"
the
vicomte
told
his
tale
very
neatly
.
it
was
an
anecdote
","
then
","
"
"
to
the
effect
that
the
duc
d’enghien
had
gone
secretly
to
paris
to
"
"
visit
mademoiselle
george
;
that
at
her
house
he
came
upon
bonaparte
","
"
"
who
also
enjoyed
the
actress
’
favors
","
and
that
in
his
presence
"
"
napoleon
happened
to
fall
into
one
of
the
fainting
fits
to
which
he
was
"
"
","
and
was
thus
at
the
duc
’s
mercy
.
the
spared
him
","
and
"
"
this
magnanimity
bonaparte
subsequently
repaid
by
death
.
"

"
the
story
was
very
and
","
especially
at
the
point
"
"
where
the
rivals
suddenly
recognized
one
another
;
and
the
ladies
looked
"
"
agitated
.
"

"
“

said
anna
pávlovna
with
an
inquiring
glance
at
the
"
"
princess

"

"
“

whispered
the
princess
","
sticking
the
needle
into

"
her
work
as
if
to
testify
that
the

"
prevented
her

"
it

it
was
a

"
cloudless

","
summer

pierre
took
an
cab

drive

.
but
the
nearer

drew
to

the
more
he
"
"
felt
the
impossibility

a
night
.
it
was
"
"
to

.
on
the
way
pierre
remembered
that

evening
","

there

passionately

to

he
was
so
to
"
"
that
he
decided

occurred
to
him
that
his

of

","
“
