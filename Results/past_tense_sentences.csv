"

rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception."

kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,
and complacently seated himself on the sofa.

"
"set your friend’s
mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the

"i
must put in an appearance there,” said the prince."

motive of his visit, “is it true that the dowager empress wants
"
baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna?
"prince vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were
trying through the dowager empress márya fëdorovna to secure it for
the baron.

"
"anna pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was
pleased with.

"
"“baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her
sister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.

"
"as she named the empress, anna pávlovna’s"
"face suddenly assumed an
expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
patroness."
"she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke
beaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.

"
the prince was silent and looked indifferent.
"but, with the womanly and
courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, anna pávlovna
wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man
recommended to the empress) and at the same time to console him, so she
said:

“now about your family."
"do you know that since your daughter came
out everyone has been enraptured by her?"
"the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.

"
"“i often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer
to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political
and social topics were ended and the time had come for"
"intimate
conversation—“i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life
are distributed."
"why has fate given you two such splendid children?

",” she
added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.

"and she smiled her ecstatic smile.

"“i can’t help it,” said the prince."

lack the bump of paternity.”

"(and her
face assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at her
majesty’s and you were pitied....”

"
"the prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
awaiting a reply."
"he frowned.

"
he said at last.
"“you know i did all
"
"a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.
"
"he said this smiling in a way
more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round
"
"his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and
unpleasant.

"
“and why are children born to such men as you?
"if you were not a
father there would be nothing i could reproach you with,” said anna
pávlovna, looking up pensively.

"
"it can’t be helped!”

"
"he said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
gesture."
"anna pávlovna meditated.

"
“have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole?”
"she
asked."
"prince vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and
perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of
the head that he was considering this information.

"
"“do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad
current of his thoughts, “that anatole is costing me forty thousand
rubles a year?"
"and,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in
five years, if he goes on like this?”"
"presently he added: “that’s
what we fathers have to put up with.... is this princess of yours
rich?”

"
"he is
the well-known prince bolkónski who had to retire from the army under
the late emperor, and was nicknamed ‘the king of prussia.’"

"
"“listen, dear annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking anna
"
"and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the
maid of honor"
"’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro
as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.

"
"“attendez,” said anna pávlovna, reflecting, “i’ll speak to
lise, young bolkónski’s wife,"
"this very evening, and perhaps the
thing can be arranged."
drawing room was gradually filling.
"the highest
petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age
and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.
"
"prince vasíli’s daughter, the beautiful hélène, came to take her
father to the ambassador’s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and
her badge as maid of honor."
"the youthful little princess bolkónskaya,
known as la femme la plus séduisante de pétersbourg, * was also there.
"
"she had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant"
"did
not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions."
"prince
vasíli’s son, hippolyte, had come with mortemart, whom he introduced.
"
"the abbé morio and many others had also come.

     "
"to each new arrival anna pávlovna said, “you have not yet seen my
aunt,” or “you do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted
"
"him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her
cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests
began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her
aunt, anna pávlovna mentioned each one’s name and then left them.

"
"each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them
cared about; anna pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
solemn interest and silent approval."
"the aunt spoke to each of them in
the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of her
majesty, “who, thank god, was better today.”"
"and each visitor,
though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman
with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not
return to her the whole evening.

"
"the young princess bolkónskaya had brought some work in a
gold-embroidered velvet bag."
"her pretty little upper lip, on which a
delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth,
but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she
occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip."
"as is always the case
with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect—the shortness of her
upper lip and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her own special and
peculiar form of beauty."
"everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty
young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and
carrying her burden so lightly."
"old men and dull dispirited young ones
who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a
little while"
", felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life
and health."
"all who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile
and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a
specially amiable mood that day.

"
"the little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying
steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat
down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a
pleasure to herself and to all around her."
"“i have brought my work,”
said she in french, displaying her bag and addressing all present.
"
"“mind, annette, i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,”
she added, turning to her hostess."
"“you wrote that it was to be quite
a small reception, and just see how badly i am dressed.”"
"and she
spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray
dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.

"
", you will always be prettier than anyone
else,” replied anna pávlovna.

"
"“you know,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
french, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me?"
"he is going
to get himself killed."
"she
added, addressing prince vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she
turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful hélène.

"
"said prince
vasíli to anna pávlovna.

"
"one of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with
close-cropped hair, spectacles,"
"the light-colored breeches fashionable
"
"this stout
young man was an illegitimate son of count bezúkhov, a well-known
grandee of catherine’s time who now lay dying in moscow."
"the young man
had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only
just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his
first appearance in society."
"anna pávlovna greeted him with the nod she
accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room."
"but in spite of
this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight
of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face
when she saw pierre enter."
"the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which
distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.

"
"“it is very good of you, monsieur pierre, to come and visit a poor
invalid,” said anna pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her
aunt as she conducted him to her.

"
"pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as
if in search of something."
"on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little
princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.

"
"’s alarm was justified, for pierre turned away from the
aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majesty’s health.
"
"anna pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: “do you know the
abbé morio?"
"“yes, i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very
interesting but hardly feasible.”

"
"rejoined anna pávlovna in order to say something
and get away to attend to her duties as hostess."
"but pierre now
committed a reverse act of impoliteness."
"first he had left a lady before
"
"she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to
another who wished to get away."
"with his head bent, and his big feet
spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé’s
plan chimerical.

"
"“we will talk of it later,” said anna pávlovna with a smile.

"
"and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she
resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready
to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag."
"as
the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes
round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the
machine or set it in proper motion, so anna pávlovna moved about her
drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a
word or slight rearrangement"
"kept the conversational machine in steady,
proper, and regular motion."
"she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached
the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and
again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé.

"
"pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at anna
"
’s was the first he had attended in russia.
"he knew that all
the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and, like a
child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing
any clever conversation that was to be heard."
"seeing the self-confident
and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always
expecting to hear something very profound."
"at last he came up to morio.
"
"here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an
opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.





"
"the spindles hummed
steadily and ceaselessly on all sides."
"with the exception of the aunt,
beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face
was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had
settled into three groups."
"one, chiefly masculine, had formed round
"
"another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful
princess hélène, prince vasíli’s daughter, and the little princess
"
"the third group was gathered round mortemart and anna pávlovna.

"
"the vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished
manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
which he found himself."
"anna pávlovna was obviously serving him up as
a treat to her guests."
"as a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a
specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in
"
"the kitchen would have cared to eat, so anna pávlovna served up to
her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice
morsels."
"the group about mortemart immediately began discussing the
murder of the duc d’enghien."
"the vicomte said that the duc d’enghien
had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular
reasons for buonaparte’s hatred of him.

"
"“ah, yes! do tell us all about it, vicomte,” said anna pávlovna,
with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la louis xv in the
sound of that sentence: “contez nous çela, vicomte.”

"
"the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to
comply."
"anna pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to
listen to his tale.

"
"“the vicomte knew the duc personally,” whispered anna pávlovna to
one of the guests."
"“the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,” said she
to another."
"“how evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she
to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest
and"
"the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.

"
"“come over here, hélène, dear,” said anna pávlovna to the
beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of
another group.

"
the princess smiled.
"she rose with the same unchanging smile with which
she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautiful
woman."
"with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss
and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling
diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking
at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the
privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders,
back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much
exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as
"
she moved toward anna pávlovna.
"hélène was so lovely that not only
did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even
appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty."
"she
seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.

"
"said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his
shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
unchanging smile.

"
"“madame, i doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he,
smilingly inclining his head.

"
"the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered
a reply unnecessary."
she smilingly waited.
"all the time the story was
being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,
"
"altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more
beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace."
"from time
to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story
produced an effect she glanced at anna pávlovna, at once adopted just
the expression she saw on the maid of honor’s face, and again relapsed
into her radiant smile.

"
"the little princess had also left the tea table and followed hélène.

"
"she went on, turning to prince hippolyte."
"there was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking
merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
seat.

"
"“now i am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin"
", she
took up her work.

"
"prince hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and
moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.

"
"his features were like his
sister’s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,
self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the
wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary
was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen
self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak."
"his eyes, nose, and
mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms
and legs always fell into unnatural positions.

"
"said he, sitting down beside
the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this
instrument he could not begin to speak.

"
"“why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging
his shoulders.

"
"“because i hate ghost stories,” said prince hippolyte in a tone
which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he
had uttered them.

"
"he spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure
whether what he said was very witty or very stupid."
"he was dressed in
a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
effrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.

"
the vicomte told his tale very neatly.
"it was an anecdote, then current,
to the effect that the duc d’enghien had gone secretly to paris to
visit mademoiselle george; that at her house he came upon bonaparte,
who also enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence
napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was
subject, and was thus at the duc’s mercy."
"the latter spared him, and
this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.

"
"the story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point
where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked
agitated.

"
"said anna pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the
little princess.

"
"whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into
her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
prevented her from going on with it.

"
"the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
prepared to continue, but just then anna pávlovna, who had kept a
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was
talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the
rescue."
"pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about
"
"the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young
man’s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory."
"both
were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why
anna pávlovna disapproved.

"
"the balance of power in europe and the rights of
the people,” the abbé was saying."
"“it is only necessary for one
powerful nation like russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place
herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object
the maintenance of the balance of power of europe, and it would save the
world!”

"
"pierre was beginning.

"
"at that moment anna pávlovna came up and, looking severely at pierre,
asked the italian how he stood russian climate."
"face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary
expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.

"
"“i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
society, more especially of the feminine society, in which i have had
"
"the honor of being received, that i have not yet had time to think of
the climate,” said he.

"
"conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the
larger circle.





"
"just then another visitor entered the drawing room: prince andrew
bolkónski, the little princess’ husband."
"he was a very handsome young
man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features."
"everything about
him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,
offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife."
"it was
evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had
found them to be"
"so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to
them."
"and among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed
to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife."
"he turned away from
her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed anna
"
"pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.

"
"“you are off to the war, prince?” said anna pávlovna.

"
"“general kutúzov,” said bolkónski, speaking french and stressing
the last syllable of the general’s name like a frenchman, “has been
pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....”

"
"“andré,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same
coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has
been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte!”

"
prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away.
"the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,
"
"affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm."
"before he looked round
"
"prince andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was
touching his arm, but when he saw pierre’s"
"beaming face he gave him an
unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.

"
"said he to
pierre.

"
"“i knew you would be here,” replied pierre."
"he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the
vicomte who was continuing his story.

"
"“no, impossible!” said prince andrew, laughing and pressing
"
’s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question.
"he
wished to say something more, but at that moment prince vasíli and his
daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.

"
"“you must excuse me, dear vicomte,” said prince vasíli to the
frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent
his rising."
"i am very sorry to leave
your enchanting party,” said he, turning to anna pávlovna.

"
"his daughter, princess hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly
holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face."
"pierre gazed at her with rapturous,
"
"almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.

"
"“very lovely,” said prince andrew.

"
"“very,” said pierre.

"
"in passing prince vasíli seized pierre’s hand and said to anna
pávlovna: “educate this bear for me!"
"he has been staying with me
a whole month"
"and this is the first time i have seen him in society.
"
anna pávlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand.
"she knew his
father to be a connection of prince vasíli’s."
"the elderly lady who
had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince
vasíli in the anteroom."
"all the affectation of interest she had assumed
had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety
and fear.

"
"“how about my son borís, prince?” said she, hurrying after him into
the anteroom."
"although prince vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely
to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an
ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go
away.

"
"“what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor, and then he
would be transferred to the guards at once?”"
"said she.

"
"“believe me, princess, i am ready to do all i can,” answered prince
vasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor."
"the elderly lady was a princess drubetskáya, belonging to one of the
best families in russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of
society had lost her former influential connections."
"she had now come to
petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son.
"
"it was, in fact, solely to meet prince vasíli that she had obtained an
invitation to anna pávlovna’s reception and had sat listening to
the vicomte’s story."
"words frightened her, an
embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;
then she smiled again and clutched prince vasíli’s arm more tightly.

"
"“listen to me, prince,” said she."
"“i have never yet asked you
for anything"
"and i never will again, nor have i ever reminded you of my
father’s friendship for you; but now i entreat you for god’s sake to
do this for my son—and i shall always regard you as a benefactor,”
"
she added hurriedly.
"i have asked
golítsyn and he has refused."
"be the kindhearted man you always were,”
"
"she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.

"
"“papa, we shall be late,” said princess hélène, turning her
beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she

"influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized
"
"prince vasíli knew this, and having once realized
that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be
unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence."
"but
in princess drubetskáya’s case he felt, after her second appeal,
"
"she had reminded him of what was
quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in
his career."
"moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of
those women—mostly mothers—who, having once made up their minds,
will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if
necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even
to make scenes."
"this last consideration moved him.

"
"“my dear anna mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity and
weariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what you
ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your father’s
memory, i will do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to the
guards."
"this is what i expected from you—i knew your
kindness!”"
"he turned to go.

"when he has been transferred to the guards...”

she faltered.
"prince vasíli smiled.

"you don’t know how kutúzov is pestered
since his appointment as commander in chief."
"he told me himself that
all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as
adjutants.”

"“papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,
"
"“do promise, do promise, vasíli!” cried anna mikháylovna as he
went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably
came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.

"
"apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed
"
"but as soon as the prince had gone her face
resumed its former cold, artificial expression."
"she returned to the
group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to
listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave."
"her task was
accomplished.





"
"asked anna pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of
genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte, and
monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of
the nations?"
"it is as
if the whole world had gone crazy.”

"
"prince andrew looked anna pávlovna straight in the face with a
sarcastic smile.

"
"they say he was
very fine when he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in
italian: “‘dio mi"
"* god has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!

"
"“i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
over,” anna pávlovna continued."
"i do not speak of russia,” said the vicomte, polite
but hopeless: “the sovereigns, madame..."
"what have they done for louis
xvii, for the queen, or for madame elizabeth?"
"and he became
more animated."
"and sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.

"
"prince hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the
little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the condé
coat of arms on the table."
"he explained this to her with as much gravity
as if she had asked him to do it.

"
",”
said he.

"
"the princess listened, smiling.

"
"“if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer,” the
vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which
he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but
follows the current of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too
far."
"by intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, french society—i
mean good french society—will have been forever destroyed, and
then....”

"
he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands.
"pierre wished to
make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but anna pávlovna,
who had him under observation, interrupted:

“the emperor alexander,”"
"said she, with the melancholy which
always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family, “has
declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose
their own form of government; and i believe that once free from the
usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms
of its rightful king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable to the
royalist emigrant.

"
"“that is doubtful,” said prince andrew."
"“monsieur le vicomte quite
rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far."
"“from what i have heard,” said pierre, blushing and breaking into
the conversation, “almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
bonaparte’s side.”

"
"“it is the buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without
looking at pierre."
"“bonaparte has said so,” remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic
smile.

"
"it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him, though without looking at him.

"
"“‘i showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow
it,’”"
"prince andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting
napoleon’s words. “"
"‘i opened my antechambers and they crowded
in.’"
"i do not know how far he was justified in saying so.”

"
"“not in the least,” replied the vicomte."
"“after the murder of the
duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero."
"if to some
people,” he went on, turning to anna pávlovna, “he ever was a hero,
"
"before anna pávlovna and the others had time to smile their
appreciation of the vicomte’s epigram, pierre again broke into the
conversation, and though anna pávlovna felt sure he would say something
inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.

"
"“the execution of the duc d’enghien,” declared monsieur pierre,
"
"“was a political necessity, and it seems to me that napoleon
showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole
responsibility of that deed.”

"
"muttered anna pávlovna in a terrified whisper.

"
"“what, monsieur pierre... do you consider that assassination shows
greatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her
"
"oh!” exclaimed several voices.

"
"“capital!” said prince hippolyte in english, and began slapping his
knee with the palm of his hand.

"
the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders.
"pierre looked solemnly at his
audience over his spectacles and continued.

"
"“i say so,” he continued desperately, “because the bourbons fled
from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and napoleon alone
understood the revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,
he could not stop short for the sake of one man’s life.”

"
"suggested anna
pávlovna.

"
"but pierre continued his speech without heeding her.

"
"“no,” cried he, becoming more and more eager, “napoleon is great
because he rose superior to the revolution, suppressed its abuses,
"
"preserved all that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom
of speech and of the press—and only for that reason did he obtain
power.”

"
"“yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to
commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, i should have
called him a great man,” remarked the vicomte.

"
"the people only gave him power that he might
rid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great
man."
"continued monsieur pierre,
betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition"
"his extreme
youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.

"
"repeated anna pávlovna.

"
"“rousseau’s contrat social,” said the vicomte with a tolerant
smile.

"
"“yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,” again interjected an
ironical voice.

"
"what is important are the rights of man, emancipation from
prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas napoleon
has retained in full force.”

"
"“liberty and equality,” said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at
"
"last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words
were, “high-sounding words which have long been discredited."
"even our saviour preached liberty and
equality."
"we wanted liberty, but buonaparte has destroyed it.”

"
"prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the
vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess."
"in the first moment of
pierre’s outburst anna pávlovna, despite her social experience, was
horror-struck."
"but when she saw that pierre’s sacrilegious words
had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was
impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
a vigorous attack on the orator.

"
"“but, my dear monsieur pierre,” said she, “how do you explain the
fact of a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is
innocent and untried?”

"
"“i should like,” said the vicomte, “to ask how monsieur explains
"
“and the prisoners he killed in africa?
"said the
little princess, shrugging her shoulders.

"
"“he’s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked prince hippolyte.

"
"pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled."
"when he smiled,
his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by
another—a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to
ask forgiveness.

"
"the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that
this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested."
"said prince
andrew."
"pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of
this reinforcement.

"
"“one must admit,” continued prince andrew, “"
"that napoleon as a man
was great on the bridge of arcola, and in the hospital at jaffa where he
gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ..."
"prince andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
pierre"
"’s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
go.

"
"suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,
and asking them all to be seated began:

“i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it.
"
"—i must tell it in russian or the point will be
lost....” and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian
as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia.
"
"everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
attention to his story.

"
"she said....”

here prince hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with
difficulty.

"
“she said....
"she said, ‘girl,’ to the maid, ‘put on a
livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while i make some
calls.’”

"
"here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator."
"several
persons, among them the elderly lady and anna pávlovna, did however
smile.

"
“she went.
"the girl lost her hat and
her long hair came down....”"
"here he could contain himself no
longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: “and the whole world
knew....”

"
and so the anecdote ended.
"though it was unintelligible why he had told
it, or why it had to be told in russian,"
"the
others appreciated prince hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably
ending pierre’s unpleasant and unamiable outburst."
"after the anecdote
the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last
and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and
where.





"
"having thanked anna pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began
to take their leave.

"
"stout, about the average height, broad, with huge
red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing
room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something
particularly agreeable before going away."
"when he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the
general’s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume,
till the general asked him to restore it."
"all his absent-mindedness and
inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however,"
"redeemed by
his kindly, simple, and modest expression."
"anna pávlovna turned toward
him and, with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his
indiscretion, nodded and said: “i hope to see you again, but i also
hope you will change your opinions, my dear monsieur pierre.”

"
"when she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody
saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, “opinions are
opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow i am.”"
"and
everyone, including anna pávlovna, felt this.

"
"prince andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders
to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened
indifferently to his wife’s chatter with prince hippolyte who had also
come into the hall."
"prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant
princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.

"
"“go in, annette, or you will catch cold,” said the little princess,
taking leave of anna pávlovna."
"“it is settled,” she added in a low
voice.

"
"anna pávlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she
contemplated between anatole and the little princess’ sister-in-law.

"
"“i rely on you, my dear,” said anna pávlovna, also in a low tone.
"
"—and she left the hall.

"
"prince hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face
close to her, began to whisper something.

"
"two footmen, the princess’ and his own, stood holding a shawl and
"
"they listened to
the french sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of
understanding but not wishing to appear to do so."
"the princess as usual
spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.

"
“i am very glad i did not go to the ambassador
"’s,” said prince
hippolyte “—"
"“they say the ball will be very good,” replied the princess, drawing
up her downy little lip."
"“not all, for you will not be there; not all,” said prince hippolyte
smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he
even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess."
"either from
awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the
shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as
though embracing her.

"
"still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her
husband."
"prince andrew’s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he
seem.

"
"he asked his wife, looking past her.

"
"prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion
reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch
following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.

"
"“princesse, au revoir,” cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well
as with his feet.

"
"the princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark
carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; prince hippolyte, under
pretense of helping, was in everyone’s way.

"
"“allow me, sir,” said prince andrew in russian in a cold,
disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path.

"
"“i am expecting you, pierre,” said the same voice, but gently and
affectionately.

"
"the postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled."
"prince hippolyte
laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
whom he had promised to take home.

"
"“well, mon cher,” said the vicomte, having seated himself beside
hippolyte in the carriage, “your little princess is very nice, very
nice indeed, quite french,” and he kissed the tips of his fingers.
"
"hippolyte burst out laughing.

"
"“do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,”
continued the vicomte."
"hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, “"
"and you were
saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french?"
"pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrew’s study like
one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took
from the shelf the first book that came to his hand"
"(it was caesar’s
commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.

"
“what have you done to mlle schérer?
"she will be quite ill now,”
said prince andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white
hands.

"
"pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak."
"he lifted his eager
face to prince andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.

"
you at last decided on anything?
"asked prince andrew after a momentary silence.

"
"pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.

"
"pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor,
and had remained away till he was twenty."
"when he returned to moscow
his father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man, “now go
to petersburg, look round, and choose your profession."
"pierre had
already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided
on anything."
"it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking.
"
"pierre rubbed his forehead.

"
"“but he must be a freemason,” said he, referring to the abbé whom
he had met that evening.

"
"prince andrew again interrupted him, “let
us talk business."
"“no, i have not; but this is what i have been thinking and wanted
to tell you."
"prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierre’s childish words.
"
"he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such
nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other
answer than the one prince andrew gave to this naïve question.

"
"“if no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no
wars,” he said.

"
"“and that would be splendid,” said pierre.

"
"prince andrew smiled ironically.

"
"“very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....”

"
"asked pierre.

"he
paused."

’s dress was heard in the next room.
"andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it
had had in anna pávlovna’s drawing room."
"pierre removed his feet from
the sofa."
the princess came in.
"she had changed her gown for a house
dress as fresh and elegant as the other."
"prince andrew rose and politely
placed a chair for her.

"
"“how is it,” she began, as usual in french, settling down briskly
and fussily in the easy chair, “how is it annette never got married?
"
how stupid you men all are not to have married her!
"i can’t understand why he
wants to go to the war,” replied pierre, addressing the princess
with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
intercourse with young women.

"
the princess started.
"evidently pierre’s words touched her to the
quick.

"
said she.
"well known, so much appreciated by everyone."
"the other day at the
apráksins’ i heard a lady asking, ‘is that the famous prince
andrew?’"
she laughed.
"“he is so well received
everywhere."
"you know
the emperor spoke to him most graciously."
"annette and i were speaking of
how to arrange it."
"pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the
conversation, gave no reply.

"he asked.

"
"i won’t hear it spoken
of,” said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which
she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly
"
"ill-suited to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member.
"
"“today when i remembered that all these delightful associations
must be broken off ... and then you know, andré...” (she looked
significantly at her husband)"
"she
whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.

"
"her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides
pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of
frigid politeness.

"
"i don’t understand,” said he.

"
"“with my father and sister, remember,” said prince andrew gently.

"
"her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a
joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression."
"she paused as if she
felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre, though the
gist of the matter lay in that.

"
"“i still can’t understand what you are afraid of,” said prince
andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.

"
"the princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.

"
"“no, andrew, i must say you have changed."
"“your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said prince andrew.
"
"“you had better go.”

"
"the princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.

"prince andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.

"pierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise, now at him and
now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.

"exclaimed the little
princess"
"suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful
grimace."
"“i have long wanted to ask you, andrew, why you have changed

what have i done to you?
was all prince andrew said.
"but that one word expressed
an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself
regret her words."
"but she went on hurriedly:

"
"did you behave
like that six months ago?”

"
"“lise, i beg you to desist,” said prince andrew still more
emphatically.

"
"pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
all this, rose and approached the princess."
"he seemed unable to bear the
sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.

"
i myself have experienced ... and so ...
"prince andrew caught him by the hand.

"
"“no, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without
restraining her angry tears.

"said prince andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch
which indicates that patience is exhausted.

"
"’ pretty
face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear."
"glanced askance at her husband’s face, and her own assumed the timid,
deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
drooping tail.

"she muttered, and lifting her dress with one
hand"
"she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.

"
"“good night, lise,” said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand
as he would have done to a stranger.





"
neither cared to begin talking.
"pierre
continually glanced at prince andrew"
"; prince andrew rubbed his forehead
with his small hand.

"
"“let us go and have supper,” he said with a sigh, going to the door.

"
"they entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.
"
"that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.
"
"halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,
with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on
his face, began to talk—as one who has long had something on his mind
and suddenly determines to speak out.

"
"that’s my advice: never marry
till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of,
"
"and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen
her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
mistake."
"marry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is
good and noble in you will be lost."
"it will all be wasted on trifles.
"
"if you marry
expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every
step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing
room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an
idiot!..."
"and he waved his arm.

"
"pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and
the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend
in amazement.

"
"“my wife,” continued prince andrew, “is an excellent woman, one
of those rare women with whom a man"
"as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkónski
who had lolled in anna pávlovna’s easy chairs and with"
"half-closed
eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth."
"every muscle of his
thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which
the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant
light."
"it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary
times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid
irritation.

"
"“you don’t understand why i say this,” he continued, “but it is
the whole story of life."
"you talk of bonaparte and his career,” said
he (though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte), “but bonaparte"
"when
he worked went step by step toward his goal."
"he was free, he had nothing
but his aim to consider, and he reached it."
"the greatest war there ever was, and i know nothing and am fit for
nothing."
"i am very amiable and have a caustic wit,” continued prince
andrew, “and at anna pávlovna"
"and that stupid
set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women...."
"if you only
knew what those society women are, and women in general!"
"when you meet them

"concluded prince andrew.

"
"“it seems funny to me,” said pierre, “that you, you should
consider yourself incapable and your life"
"he did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he
thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.

"
thought pierre.
"he considered his
friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the
highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked, and which might
be best described as strength of will."
"pierre was always astonished at
prince andrew’s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary
memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything,
and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for
work and study."
"and if pierre was often struck by andrew’s lack
of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was
particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a
sign of strength.

"
"“my part is played out,” said prince andrew."
",” he added after a silence,
smiling at his reassuring thoughts.

"
"that smile was immediately reflected on pierre’s face.

"
"said pierre, his face relaxing
into a careless, merry smile."
"he suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great
effort to say this."
” but he did not say what “it really” was.
"what
i am to do; i wanted to consult you seriously.”

"
"prince andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance—friendly and
"
"affectionate as it was—expressed a sense of his own superiority.

"
"answered pierre, shrugging
his shoulders."
"“i don’t understand it,” replied prince andrew."
"pierre was staying at prince vasíli kurágin’s and sharing the
dissipated life of his son anatole, the son whom they were planning to
reform by marrying him to prince andrew’s sister.

"
"“do you know?” said pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy
thought, “seriously, i have long been thinking of it...."
"he asked me for tonight, but i
won’t go.”

"
it was past one o’clock when pierre left his friend.
"pierre took an open cab intending
to drive straight home."
"but the nearer he drew to the house the more he
felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night."
"it was light
enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like
morning or evening than night."
"on the way pierre remembered that anatole
kurágin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which
there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind
"
"“i should like to go to kurágin’s,” thought he.

"
"but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go
there."
"then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
that he decided to go."
"the thought immediately occurred to him that his
promise to prince andrew was of no account, because before he gave it
he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering;
"
"“besides,” thought he, “all such ‘words of honor’ are
conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if
one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so

"pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying
all his decisions and intentions."
"he went to kurágin’s.

"
"reaching the large house near the horse guards’ barracks, in which
anatole lived, pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs,
and went in at the open door."
"there was no one in the anteroom; empty
bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of
alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.

"cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.

remains of supper."

the sly what was left in the glasses.
"from the third room came sounds of
laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and
general commotion."
"some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
round an open window."
"three others were romping with a young bear, one
pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.

"
"“i bet a hundred on stevens!” shouted one.

"
"“mind, no holding on!” cried another.

"
cried a third.
"shouted a fourth.

"
"shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow
who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine
linen shirt unfastened in front."
"cried he, addressing pierre.

"
"another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,
particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober
ring, cried from the window: “come here; part the bets!”"
"this was
dólokhov, an officer of the semënov regiment, a notorious gambler and
duelist, who was living with anatole."
"pierre smiled, looking about him
merrily.

"
"a bottle here,” said anatole, and
taking a glass from the table"
"he went up to pierre.

"
"pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at
"
"the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening
to their chatter."
anatole kept on refilling pierre
"while
explaining that dólokhov was betting with stevens, an english naval
officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.

"
"“go on, you must drink it all,” said anatole, giving pierre the last
glass, “"
"“no, i won’t,” said pierre, pushing anatole aside, and he went up
to the window.

"
"dólokhov was holding the englishman’s hand and clearly and distinctly
repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to
anatole and pierre.

"
"like all infantry officers he wore no mustache,
so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly
seen."
the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved.
"the middle
of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm
lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually
round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute,
insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it
impossible not to notice his face."
"yet, though anatole spent tens of thousands of
rubles, dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a
footing that all who knew them, including anatole himself, respected him
more than they did anatole."
"dólokhov could play all games and nearly
always won."
"however much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness.
"
the bottle of rum was brought.
"the window frame which prevented anyone
from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who
were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
the gentlemen around.

"
"he wanted to
smash something."
"pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but
could not move it."
"he smashed a pane.

"
"“you have a try, hercules,” said he, turning to pierre.

"
"pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with
a crash.

"
"“take it right out, or they’ll think i’m holding on,” said
dólokhov.

"
"said anatole.

"
"“first-rate,” said pierre, looking at dólokhov, who with a bottle
of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of
the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.

"
"dólokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window
sill."
"cried he, standing there and addressing those in the
room."
"“i bet fifty imperials”—he spoke french that the englishman might
understand him, but he did not speak it very"
"added he,
addressing the englishman.

"
"“no, fifty,” replied the latter.

"
"(he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window)
"
"“quite right,” said the englishman.

"
"anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons
of his coat and looking down at him—the englishman was short—began
repeating the terms of the wager to him in english.

"
"cried dólokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window
"
"the englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to
accept this challenge or not."
"anatole did not release him, and though
he kept nodding to show that he understood, anatole went on translating
dólokhov’s words into english."
"a thin young lad, an hussar of the
life guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window
sill, leaned over, and looked down.

"
"he muttered, looking down from the window at the
stones of the pavement.

"
“shut up!”
"cried dólokhov, pushing him away from the window."
"the
lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.

"
"placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,
dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered
his legs."
"pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself
on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to
the left, and took up the bottle."
"anatole brought two candles and
placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.
"
"dólokhov’s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit
up from both sides."
"everyone crowded to the window, the englishman in
front."
pierre stood smiling but silent.
"one man, older than the others
present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted
to seize hold of dólokhov’s shirt.

"
"he’ll be killed,” said this more sensible
man.

"
"anatole stopped him.

"
"you’ll startle him and then he’ll be killed.
eh?..."
"dólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged
himself on his seat.

"
"“if anyone comes meddling again,” said he, emitting the words
separately through his thin compressed lips, “i will throw him down
there."
"saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle
and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand
to balance himself."
"one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
window and from dólokhov’s back."
"anatole stood erect with staring
eyes."
"the englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips."
"the man
who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw
himself on a sofa with his face to the wall."
"pierre hid his face, from
which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed
horror and fear."
"pierre took his hands from his eyes.
"
"dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown
further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand
holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the
effort."
"the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher
and his head tilting yet further back."
"thought
pierre."
"it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed.
"
"suddenly dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm
trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip
as he sat on the sloping ledge."
"as he began slipping down, his head and
arm wavered still more with the strain."
"one hand moved as if to clutch
"
"the window sill, but refrained from touching it."
"pierre again covered
his eyes and thought he would never open them again."
"he looked up: dólokhov was standing on the
window sill, with a pale but radiant face.

"
"he threw the bottle to the englishman, who caught it neatly."
"dólokhov
jumped down."
"he smelt strongly of rum.

"
“well done!...
"came from different sides.

"
"the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.
"
dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak.
"pierre jumped upon the
window sill.

"
he suddenly cried.
"“let him do it, let him do it,” said dólokhov, smiling.

"
have you gone mad?...
",” exclaimed several voices.

"
"shouted pierre,
banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to
climb out of the window.

"
"they seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who
touched him was sent flying.

"
"“no, you’ll never manage him that way,” said anatole."
"“come on then,” cried pierre."
"and he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,
and began dancing round the room with it.





"
"prince vasíli kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskáya
who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son borís on the evening of
anna pávlovna’s soiree."
"the matter was mentioned to the emperor, an
exception made, and borís transferred into the regiment of semënov
guards with the rank of cornet."
"he received, however, no appointment
to kutúzov"
"soon after anna pávlovna’s reception anna mikháylovna
returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the
rostóvs, with whom she stayed when in the town and"
"where her darling
bóry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being
at once transferred to the guards as a cornet, had been educated from
childhood and lived for years at a time."
"the guards had already left
petersburg on the tenth of august, and her son, who had remained in
moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to radzivílov.

"
"it was st. natalia’s day and the name day of two of the rostóvs—the
mother and the youngest daughter—both named nataly."
"ever since
the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going
continually, bringing visitors to the countess rostóva’s big house on
the povarskáya, so well known to all moscow."
"the countess herself and
her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors
who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in
relays.

"
"the countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin oriental type
of face, evidently worn out with childbearing—she had had twelve.
"
"a languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a
distinguished air which inspired respect."
"princess anna mikháylovna
drubetskáya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the
drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors."
"the young
people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to
take part in receiving the visitors."
"the count met the guests and saw
them off, inviting them all to dinner.

"
"“i am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,” or “ma chère”—he
called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation
in his tone, “my dear,” whether they were above or below him in
rank—“i thank you for myself and for our two dear ones"
"or i shall be offended,
"
"these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and
with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the
same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows."
"as
soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were
still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily
spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air
of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and
fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on
questions of health, sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but
self-confident french; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in
the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking
his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.

"sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the

table linen, he would call dmítri vasílevich, a man of good family and
