aunt,” or “you do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted
"
"him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her
cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests
began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her
aunt, anna pávlovna mentioned each one’s name and then left them.

"
"each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them
cared about; anna pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
solemn interest and silent approval."
"the aunt spoke to each of them in
the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of her
majesty, “who, thank god, was better today.”"
"and each visitor,
though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman
with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not
return to her the whole evening.

"

carrying her burden so lightly."

who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a
little while"
", felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life
and health."

steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat
down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a
pleasure to herself and to all around her."
"“i have brought my work,”
said she in french, displaying her bag and addressing all present.

she added, turning to her hostess."
"“you wrote that it was to be quite
a small reception, and just see how badly i am dressed.”"

french, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me?"

added, addressing prince vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she

"“it is very good of you, monsieur pierre, to come and visit a poor
invalid,” said anna pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her
aunt as she conducted him to her.

"
"’s alarm was justified, for pierre turned away from the
aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majesty’s health.
"
"anna pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: “do you know the
abbé morio?"
"“yes, i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very
interesting but hardly feasible.”

"
“you think so?”
"she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to
another who wished to get away."
"with his head bent, and his big feet
spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé’s
plan chimerical.

"
"and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she
resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready
to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag."
"as
the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes
round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the
machine or set it in proper motion, so anna pávlovna moved about her
drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a
word or slight rearrangement"
"she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached
the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and
again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé.

"
"he knew that all
the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and, like a
child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing
any clever conversation that was to be heard."
"seeing the self-confident
and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always
expecting to hear something very profound."
"here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an
opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.





"
"the vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished
manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
which he found himself."
"anna pávlovna was obviously serving him up as
a treat to her guests."
"as a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a
specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in
"
"the group about mortemart immediately began discussing the
murder of the duc d’enghien."
"“ah, yes! do tell us all about it, vicomte,” said anna pávlovna,
with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la louis xv in the
sound of that sentence: “contez nous çela, vicomte.”

"
"anna pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to
listen to his tale.

"
"“the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,” said she
to another."
"“how evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she
to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest
and"
"“come over here, hélène, dear,” said anna pávlovna to the
beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of
another group.

"
"with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss
and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling
diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking
at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the
privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders,
back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much
exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as
"
"“madame, i doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he,
smilingly inclining his head.

"
"all the time the story was
being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,
"
"now then, what are you
thinking of?”"
"she went on, turning to prince hippolyte."
"there was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking
merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
seat.

"
"“now i am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin"
"prince hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and
moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.

"
“it’s not going to be a ghost story?”
"said he, sitting down beside
the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this
instrument he could not begin to speak.

"
"“why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging
his shoulders.

"
"“because i hate ghost stories,” said prince hippolyte in a tone
which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he
had uttered them.

"
"it was an anecdote, then current,
to the effect that the duc d’enghien had gone secretly to paris to
visit mademoiselle george; that at her house he came upon bonaparte,
who also enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence
napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was
subject, and was thus at the duc’s mercy."
"said anna pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the
little princess.

"
"whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into
her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
prevented her from going on with it.

"
"the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
prepared to continue, but just then anna pávlovna, who had kept a
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was
talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the
rescue."
"the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young
man’s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory."
"both
were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why
anna pávlovna disapproved.

"
"the balance of power in europe and the rights of
the people,” the abbé was saying."
"“it is only necessary for one
powerful nation like russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place
herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object
the maintenance of the balance of power of europe, and it would save the
world!”

"
"pierre was beginning.

"
"at that moment anna pávlovna came up and, looking severely at pierre,
asked the italian how he stood russian climate."
"face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary
expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.

"
"“i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
society, more especially of the feminine society, in which i have had
"
"the honor of being received, that i have not yet had time to think of
the climate,” said he.

"
"not letting the abbé and pierre escape, anna pávlovna, the more
"
"he was a very handsome young
man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features."
"pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.

"
"“you are off to the war, prince?” said anna pávlovna.

"
"“general kutúzov,” said bolkónski, speaking french and stressing
the last syllable of the general’s name like a frenchman, “has been
pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....”

"
"“are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?”

"
"“andré,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same
coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has
been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte!”

"
"prince andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was
touching his arm, but when he saw pierre’s"
"beaming face he gave him an
unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.

"
"he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the
vicomte who was continuing his story.

"
"“no, impossible!” said prince andrew, laughing and pressing
"
"“you must excuse me, dear vicomte,” said prince vasíli to the
frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent
his rising."
"“this unfortunate fete at the ambassador’s deprives me
of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you."
"i am very sorry to leave
your enchanting party,” said he, turning to anna pávlovna.

"
"his daughter, princess hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly
holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face."
"in passing prince vasíli seized pierre’s hand and said to anna
pávlovna: “educate this bear for me!"
"he has been staying with me
a whole month"
"and this is the first time i have seen him in society.
"
"the elderly lady who
had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince
vasíli in the anteroom."
"“how about my son borís, prince?” said she, hurrying after him into
the anteroom."
"although prince vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely
to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an
ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go
away.

"
"“believe me, princess, i am ready to do all i can,” answered prince
vasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor."
"the elderly lady was a princess drubetskáya, belonging to one of the
best families in russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of
society had lost her former influential connections."
"it was, in fact, solely to meet prince vasíli that she had obtained an
invitation to anna pávlovna’s reception and had sat listening to
the vicomte’s story."
"“i have never yet asked you
for anything"
"and i never will again, nor have i ever reminded you of my
father’s friendship for you; but now i entreat you for god’s sake to
do this for my son—and i shall always regard you as a benefactor,”
"
"i have asked
golítsyn and he has refused."
"she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.

"
"“papa, we shall be late,” said princess hélène, turning her
beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she
stood waiting by the door.

"
"influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized
"
if it is to last.
"prince vasíli knew this, and having once realized
that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be
unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence."
"moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of
those women—mostly mothers—who, having once made up their minds,
will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if
necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even
to make scenes."
"“my dear anna mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity and
weariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what you
ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your father’s
memory, i will do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to the
guards."
"this is what i expected from you—i knew your
kindness!”"
"when he has been transferred to the guards...”
"
"“you are on good terms with michael ilariónovich
kutúzov ... recommend borís to him as adjutant!"
"you don’t know how kutúzov is pestered
since his appointment as commander in chief."
"he told me himself that
all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as
adjutants.”

"
"you hear her?”

"
"“certainly; but about kutúzov, i don’t promise.”

"
"“do promise, do promise, vasíli!” cried anna mikháylovna as he
went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably
came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.

"
"she returned to the
group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to
listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave."
"“and what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at
milan?”"
"asked anna pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of
genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte, and
monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of
the nations?"
it is enough to make one’s
"it is as
if the whole world had gone crazy.”

"
"they say he was
very fine when he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in
italian: “‘dio mi"
"* god has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!

"
"“i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
over,” anna pávlovna continued."
"“the sovereigns will not be able to
endure this man who is a menace to everything.”

"
"i do not speak of russia,” said the vicomte, polite
but hopeless: “the sovereigns, madame..."
"what have they done for louis
xvii, for the queen, or for madame elizabeth?"
"“and believe me, they are reaping the reward of their
betrayal of the bourbon cause."
"why, they are sending
ambassadors to compliment the usurper.”

"
"and sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.

"
"prince hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the
little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the condé
coat of arms on the table."
"the princess listened, smiling.

"
"“if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer,” the
vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which
he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but
follows the current of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too
far."
"by intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, french society—i
mean good french society—will have been forever destroyed, and
then....”

"
"said she, with the melancholy which
always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family, “has
declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose
their own form of government; and i believe that once free from the
usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms
of its rightful king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable to the
royalist emigrant.

"
"“that is doubtful,” said prince andrew."
"“monsieur le vicomte quite
rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far."
"i think it will
be difficult to return to the old regime.”

"
"“from what i have heard,” said pierre, blushing and breaking into
the conversation, “almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
bonaparte’s side.”

"
"“it is the buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without
looking at pierre."
"“at the present time it is difficult to know the
real state of french public opinion.”

"
"“bonaparte has said so,” remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic
smile.

"
"it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him, though without looking at him.

"
"prince andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting
napoleon’s words. “"
"i do not know how far he was justified in saying so.”

"
"if to some
people,” he went on, turning to anna pávlovna, “he ever was a hero,
"
"“was a political necessity, and it seems to me that napoleon
showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole
responsibility of that deed.”

"
"“what, monsieur pierre... do you consider that assassination shows
greatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her
"
"“capital!” said prince hippolyte in english, and began slapping his
knee with the palm of his hand.

"
"“i say so,” he continued desperately, “because the bourbons fled
from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and napoleon alone
understood the revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,
he could not stop short for the sake of one man’s life.”

"
"but pierre continued his speech without heeding her.

"
"“no,” cried he, becoming more and more eager, “napoleon is great
because he rose superior to the revolution, suppressed its abuses,
"
"“yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to
commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, i should have
called him a great man,” remarked the vicomte.

"
"continued monsieur pierre,
betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition"
"“i am not speaking of regicide, i am speaking about ideas.”

"
"what is important are the rights of man, emancipation from
prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas napoleon
has retained in full force.”

"
"last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words
were, “high-sounding words which have long been discredited."
"who does
not love liberty and equality?"
have people since the revolution become happier?
"we wanted liberty, but buonaparte has destroyed it.”

"
"prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the
vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess."
"“but, my dear monsieur pierre,” said she, “how do you explain the
fact of a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is
innocent and untried?”

"
"“i should like,” said the vicomte, “to ask how monsieur explains
"
"said the
little princess, shrugging her shoulders.

"
"“he’s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked prince hippolyte.

"
"pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled."
"the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that
this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested."
“how do you expect him to answer you all at once?”
"“besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish
between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.
"
"so it seems to me.”

"
"but there are other acts
which it is difficult to justify.”

"
"suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,
and asking them all to be seated began:

“i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it.
"
"—i must tell it in russian or the point will be
lost....” and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian
as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia.
"
"she said....”

here prince hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with
difficulty.

"
"she said, ‘girl,’ to the maid, ‘put on a
livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while i make some
calls.’”

"
"here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator."
"the
others appreciated prince hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably
ending pierre’s unpleasant and unamiable outburst."
"having thanked anna pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began
to take their leave.

"
"stout, about the average height, broad, with huge
red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing
room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something
particularly agreeable before going away."
"when he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the
general’s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume,
till the general asked him to restore it."
"anna pávlovna turned toward
him and, with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his
indiscretion, nodded and said: “i hope to see you again, but i also
hope you will change your opinions, my dear monsieur pierre.”

"
"when she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody
saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, “opinions are
opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow i am.”"
"and
everyone, including anna pávlovna, felt this.

"
"prince andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders
to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened
indifferently to his wife’s chatter with prince hippolyte who had also
come into the hall."
"“go in, annette, or you will catch cold,” said the little princess,
taking leave of anna pávlovna."
"“it is settled,” she added in a low
voice.

"
"“i rely on you, my dear,” said anna pávlovna, also in a low tone.
"
“write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter.
"prince hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face
close to her, began to whisper something.

"
"two footmen, the princess’ and his own, stood holding a shawl and
"
"a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish."
"they listened to
the french sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of
understanding but not wishing to appear to do so."
“i am very glad i did not go to the ambassador
"“they say the ball will be very good,” replied the princess, drawing
up her downy little lip."
"“not all, for you will not be there; not all,” said prince hippolyte
smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he
even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess."
"either from
awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the
shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as
though embracing her.

"
"still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her
husband."
"he asked his wife, looking past her.

"
"prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion
reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch
following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.

"
"“princesse, au revoir,” cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well
as with his feet.

"
"the princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark
carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; prince hippolyte, under
pretense of helping, was in everyone’s way.

"
"“allow me, sir,” said prince andrew in russian in a cold,
disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path.

"
"“i am expecting you, pierre,” said the same voice, but gently and
affectionately.

"
"prince hippolyte
laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
whom he had promised to take home.

"
"“well, mon cher,” said the vicomte, having seated himself beside
hippolyte in the carriage, “your little princess is very nice, very
nice indeed, quite french,” and he kissed the tips of his fingers.
"
"hippolyte burst out laughing.

"
"“do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,”
continued the vicomte."
"“i pity the poor husband, that little officer
who gives himself the airs of a monarch.”

"
"and you were
saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french?"
"one has to
know how to deal with them.”

"
"pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrew’s study like
one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took
from the shelf the first book that came to his hand"
"(it was caesar’s
commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.

"
“what have you done to mlle schérer?
"she will be quite ill now,”
said prince andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white
hands.

"
"pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak."
"“that abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
right light...."
"in my opinion perpetual peace is possible but—i do not
know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....”

"
"“one can’t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher."
"are you going to be a guardsman or a
diplomatist?”"
"“really, i don’t yet know."
"i don’t like either the one or the
other.”

"
"your father expects it.”

"
"pierre had
already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided
on anything."
"it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking.
"
"“but he must be a freemason,” said he, referring to the abbé whom
he had met that evening.

"
"“no, i have not; but this is what i have been thinking and wanted
to tell you."
"but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is
not right.”

"
"he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such
nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other
answer than the one prince andrew gave to this naïve question.

"
"“well, why are you going to the war?”"
i don’t know.
besides that i am going....”
"“i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit
me!”





"
"andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it
had had in anna pávlovna’s drawing room."
"“how is it,” she began, as usual in french, settling down briskly
and fussily in the easy chair, “how is it annette never got married?
"
how stupid you men all are not to have married her!
"excuse me for saying
"
“and i am still arguing with your husband.
"i can’t understand why he
wants to go to the war,” replied pierre, addressing the princess
with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
intercourse with young women.

"
"“ah, that is just what i tell him!”"
"“i don’t
understand it; i don’t in the least"
"how is it that we women don’t want anything of the kind,
"
don’t need it?
"i always tell him: here
he is uncle’s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position."
"the other day at the
apráksins’ i heard a lady asking, ‘is that the famous prince
andrew?’"
"“he is so well received
everywhere."
"you know
the emperor spoke to him most graciously."
"annette and i were speaking of
how to arrange it."
"what do you think?”

"
"pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the
conversation, gave no reply.

"
“when are you starting?”
"“oh, don’t speak of his going, don’t!"
"“today when i remembered that all these delightful associations
must be broken off ... and then you know, andré...” (she looked
significantly at her husband)"
"“i’m afraid, i’m afraid!”"
"i don’t understand,” said he.

"
"“there, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists!"
"just for a whim
of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone
in the country.”

"
"and he expects me not to
be afraid.”

"
"her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a
joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression."
"“i still can’t understand what you are afraid of,” said prince
andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.

"
"“no, andrew, i must say you have changed."
"“your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said prince andrew.
"
“why should i mind monsieur pierre being here?”
"“i have long wanted to ask you, andrew, why you have changed
"
what have i done to you?
"you are going to the war and have no
pity for me."
“you treat me like an invalid or a child.
i see it all!
"“lise, i beg you to desist,” said prince andrew still more
emphatically.

"
"pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
all this, rose and approached the princess."
it seems so to you because....
"i assure you
"
i myself have experienced ... and so ...
"the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of
the pleasure of spending the evening with you.”

"
"“no, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without
restraining her angry tears.

"
"said prince andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch
which indicates that patience is exhausted.

"
"’ pretty
face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear."
"glanced askance at her husband’s face, and her own assumed the timid,
deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
drooping tail.

"
"she muttered, and lifting her dress with one
hand"
"“good night, lise,” said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand
as he would have done to a stranger.





"
neither cared to begin talking.
"“let us go and have supper,” he said with a sigh, going to the door.

"
"halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,
with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on
his face, began to talk—as one who has long had something on his mind
and suddenly determines to speak out.

"
"that’s my advice: never marry
till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of,
"
"and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen
her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
mistake."
"marry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is
good and noble in you will be lost."
"if you marry
expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every
step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing
room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an
idiot!..."
but what’s the good?...”
"“my wife,” continued prince andrew, “is an excellent woman, one
of those rare women with whom a man"
"’s honor is safe; but, o god, what
would i not give now to be unmarried!"
"whom i mention this, because i like you.”

"
"every muscle of his
thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which
the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant
light."
"“you don’t understand why i say this,” he continued, “but it is
the whole story of life."
"you talk of bonaparte and his career,” said
he (though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte), “but bonaparte"
"but tie yourself up with
a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom!"
"and all you
have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with
regret."
"drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality—these are
the enchanted circle i cannot escape from."
"i am now going to the war,
"
"the greatest war there ever was, and i know nothing and am fit for
nothing."
"i am very amiable and have a caustic wit,” continued prince
andrew, “and at anna pávlovna"
’s they listen to me.
"if you only
knew what those society women are, and women in general!"
"that’s what
women are when you see them in their true colors!"
"when you meet them
in society it seems as if there were something in them, but there’s
"
"no, don’t marry, my dear fellow; don’t
marry!”"
"“it seems funny to me,” said pierre, “that you, you should
consider yourself incapable and your life"
"pierre was always astonished at
prince andrew’s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary
memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything,
and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for
work and study."
"even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise
and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels
that they may run smoothly.

"
"“my part is played out,” said prince andrew."
"“what’s the use of
talking about me?"
",” he added after a silence,
smiling at his reassuring thoughts.

"
“but what is there to say about me?”
"said pierre, his face relaxing
into a careless, merry smile."
"what
i am to do; i wanted to consult you seriously.”

"
"yes, you’re all right!"
choose what you will; it’s
"but look here: give up visiting
those kurágins and leading that sort of life."
"it suits you so
badly—all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!”

"
"answered pierre, shrugging
his shoulders."
"“i don’t understand it,” replied prince andrew."
"“women who are
comme il faut, that’s a different matter; but the kurágins’ set of
women, ‘women and wine’ i don’t understand!”

"
"pierre was staying at prince vasíli kurágin’s and sharing the
dissipated life of his son anatole, the son whom they were planning to
reform by marrying him to prince andrew’s sister.

"
"“do you know?” said pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy
thought, “seriously, i have long been thinking of it...."
"leading such
a life i can’t decide or think properly about anything."
"one’s head
aches, and one spends all one’s money."
"“you give me your word of honor not to go?”

"
"but the nearer he drew to the house the more he
felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night."
"on the way pierre remembered that anatole
kurágin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which
there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind
"
"then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
that he decided to go."
"“besides,” thought he, “all such ‘words of honor’ are
conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if
one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so
"
"pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying
all his decisions and intentions."
"reaching the large house near the horse guards’ barracks, in which
anatole lived, pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs,
and went in at the open door."
"there was no one in the anteroom; empty
bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of
alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.

"
"a footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on
"
"some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
round an open window."
"three others were romping with a young bear, one
pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.

"
"“i bet a hundred on stevens!” shouted one.

"
“i bet on dólokhov!”
"“kurágin, you part our
hands.”

"
"“there, leave bruin alone; here’s a bet on.”

"
"“at one draught, or he loses!”"
"“wait a bit, you fellows...."
"cried he, addressing pierre.

"
"another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,
particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober
ring, cried from the window: “come here; part the bets!”"
"this was
dólokhov, an officer of the semënov regiment, a notorious gambler and
duelist, who was living with anatole."
"pierre smiled, looking about him
merrily.

"
“i don’t understand.
"what’s it all about?”

"
"“wait a bit, he is not drunk yet!"
"a bottle here,” said anatole, and
taking a glass from the table"
"pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at
"
"the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening
to their chatter."
anatole kept on refilling pierre
"while
explaining that dólokhov was betting with stevens, an english naval
officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.

"
"“go on, you must drink it all,” said anatole, giving pierre the last
glass, “"
"“no, i won’t,” said pierre, pushing anatole aside, and he went up
to the window.

"
"dólokhov was holding the englishman’s hand and clearly and distinctly
repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to
anatole and pierre.

"
"yet, though anatole spent tens of thousands of
rubles, dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a
footing that all who knew them, including anatole himself, respected him
more than they did anatole."
"the window frame which prevented anyone
from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who
were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
the gentlemen around.

"
anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window.
"pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but
could not move it."
"“you have a try, hercules,” said he, turning to pierre.

"
"“take it right out, or they’ll think i’m holding on,” said
dólokhov.

"
"“first-rate,” said pierre, looking at dólokhov, who with a bottle
of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of
the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.

"
"cried he, standing there and addressing those in the
room."
"“i bet fifty imperials”—he spoke french that the englishman might
understand him, but he did not speak it very"
"well—“i bet fifty
imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?”"
"added he,
addressing the englishman.

"
"that i will drink a whole bottle of
rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this
spot”"
“and without holding on to anything.
"anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons
of his coat and looking down at him—the englishman was short—began
repeating the terms of the wager to him in english.

"
"cried dólokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window
"
"if
anyone else does the same, i will pay him a hundred imperials."
"do you
understand?”

"
"anatole did not release him, and though
he kept nodding to show that he understood, anatole went on translating
dólokhov’s words into english."
"a thin young lad, an hussar of the
life guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window
sill, leaned over, and looked down.

"
"he muttered, looking down from the window at the
stones of the pavement.

"
"cried dólokhov, pushing him away from the window."
"the
lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.

"
"placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,
dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered
his legs."
"pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself
on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to
the left, and took up the bottle."
"dólokhov’s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit
up from both sides."
pierre stood smiling but silent.
"“i say, this is folly!"
“don’t touch him!
"dólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged
himself on his seat.

"
"“if anyone comes meddling again,” said he, emitting the words
separately through his thin compressed lips, “i will throw him down
there."
"saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle
and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand
to balance himself."
"one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
window and from dólokhov’s back."
"anatole stood erect with staring
eyes."
"the englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips."
"dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown
further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand
holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the
effort."
"the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher
and his head tilting yet further back."
"as he began slipping down, his head and
arm wavered still more with the strain."
"the window sill, but refrained from touching it."
"he looked up: dólokhov was standing on the
window sill, with a pale but radiant face.

"
"“it’s empty.”

"
there’s a bet for you!...
"the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.
"
dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak.
"“gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me?"
"“let him do it, let him do it,” said dólokhov, smiling.

"
have you gone mad?...
"why, you go

"shouted pierre,
banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to
climb out of the window.

"they seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who
touched him was sent flying.

"
"but now we are all going to ——’s.”

"
"and he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,
and began dancing round the room with it.





"
"where her darling
bóry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being
at once transferred to the guards as a cornet, had been educated from
childhood and lived for years at a time."
"ever since
the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going
continually, bringing visitors to the countess rostóva’s big house on
the povarskáya, so well known to all moscow."
"a languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a
distinguished air which inspired respect."
"the young
people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to
take part in receiving the visitors."
"the count met the guests and saw
them off, inviting them all to dinner.

fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on
questions of health, sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but
self-confident french; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in
the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking
his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.
